This is a test.

This is a test of the Emergency Broadcast System. The broadcasters of your area, in voluntary cooperation with federal, state, and local authorities have developed this system to keep you informed in the event of an emergency. If this had been an actual emergency, the attention signal you never really heard would have been followed by official news, information, and instructions. This station serves no area in particular. This concludes this test of the Emergency Broadcast System.
